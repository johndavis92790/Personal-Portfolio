        <p>
          My love of technology might trace back to my high school Java class or
          the time I built my first computer at age 12. After helping my family
          business achieve its highest revenues ever and successfully sell to
          new ownership, I look forward to joining an industry well-suited to my
          ideas, resourcefulness, and technical skills.
