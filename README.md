This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Description 

This is my developer portfolio to show off some of the projects that I have created in my time at the University of Utah Web Development BootCamp. I was able to create this site using React and React Router and Bootstrap. I learned how to create a basic React app and how to use React Router to take care of the navigation side of things. I love how react works and I cannot wait to get much better and faster at creating react sites. I really do believe that its a better way to create websites, but it just entails a steep learning curve. I also decided to learn how to implement this site to AWS and get my own custom domain. That proccess went fairly smooth and I am proud to show this off.
